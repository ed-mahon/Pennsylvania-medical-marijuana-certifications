# Pennsylvania-medical-marijuana-certifications
<p>After a court battle, the Pennsylvania Department of Health shared records with Spotlight PA of more than 1.13 million medical marijuana certifications created from November 2017 through August 2022.</p>
<p>These certifications allow hundreds of thousands of patients to legally use cannabis in the state. The news organization's analysis offered the first comprehensive look at how the decision to add anxiety disorders as a qualifying condition transformed Pennsylvania’s program, and, in the eyes of some, made it possible for basically anyone to get a medical marijuana card.</p>
<p></p><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/01/pa-medical-marijuana-certification-card-anxiety/">For Spotlight PA's analysis and investigation in January 2023,</a> the news organization excluded about 31,000 of the 1.13 million certifications — or 2.8% — from its analysis. The health department placed certifications in one of nine status categories. Our analysis looked at two of those: active and expired. We excluded the other seven categories, such as ones that were created in error, never used, or canceled at the request of the practitioner. Those seven statuses accounted for a small percentage of the total certifications.</p>
<p>The news organization also excluded three additional certifications that did not have any qualifying condition listed, and 408 certifications that were created before 2021 and still labeled as active in the records the state provided. The maximum time period for a certification is 12 months.</p>
<p>Spotlight PA went into greater detail about its reporting in this <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2023/01/pa-medical-marijuana-certification-card-anxiety-analysis/">explainer article.</p>
<p>Depending on the specifics of your analysis, you could consider excluding more or less than what Spotlight PA did for its January 2022 investigation.</p>
<p>The file Certifications (2017).xlsx includes both certifications created that year and an information sheet that explains key terms for all of the data sheets, such as Treatment Period, Zip Code, and Certification Status. You should refer to the information sheet in the file Certifications (2017).xlsx for whichever years you are analyzing.</p>
